Maze Generator and Solver
========
<i>By: Matt Antonelli</i>

This Java application was designed to procedurally generate a maze using a randomized implemenation of Prim's Algorithm and solve the maze using the left-hand rule.

The GUI highlights the starting cell in <i>blue</i> and the ending cell in <i>green</i>. While the maze is being calculated, the
current cell being checked is highlighted in <i>red</i>.

The user can currently control the width of the cells, and in future implementations will be able to choose different generation and solving algorithms.

Quick generating and quick solving can both be enabled for users who do not want to watch the generation and calculating animations.

<b>Maze Generator and Solver</b><br />
<i>By Matt Antonelli</i>

========

This Java application was designed to procedurally generate a maze using an implemenation of Prim's Algorithm and solve the maze using the left-hand rule.

The GUI highlights the starting cell in <i>blue</i> and the ending cell in <i>green</i>. While the maze is being calculated, the
current cell being checked is highlighted in <i>red</i>.

Currently, only the maze generation has been implemented.
